Thank you very much for being here today. Prediction, far from being a mystic power, is something we do on our daily lives.

???

For example, if you play frisbee, you need to predict the position of the frisbee in order to be able to catch it. 

---

# Linguistic prediction

--
## Pre-activation of stored linguistic information

--

## Important for: **sentence comprehension**

--

## Listeners are not passive, they **generate expectations**

???

Language is no exception to these anticipatory mechanisms. During this presentation, prediction or anticipation are synonyms, meaning: pre-activation of stored linguistic information before it is actually said.

---


# Goals

- ### Can experience with complex processing (interpreting)  train anticipatory processing?
--


- ### Are there differences in the use of lexical stress and vowel duration for morphology anticipation between interpreters, non-interpreters and monolinguals?

# Morphosyntactic &lt;br/&gt; anticipation &lt;br/&gt; 

???

I will start by reviewing the literature on morphological, both during native and second language processing.

---

# L1 Morphosyntactic Anticipation

- Monolinguals anticipate rapidly and effortlessly (Kamide, 2008), although not under all circumstances (Nieuwland et al., 2018)

- Monolingual adults and children use gender agreement to make morphosyntactic predictions (Spanish, Dutch, German, French) (Dussias et al., 2013)
    - Eg. "Encuentra la galleta" (Find the-FEM cookie)
    
- Case-marking is also used predictively by monolinguals in Japanese (Mitsugi &amp; MacWhinney, 2016) and German (Hopp, 2015)


---

# L2 Morphosyntactic Anticipation


- ## Intermediate late learners:

    - reduced or no integration of L2 discourse cues (Grüter et al., 2017), syntactic cues (Grüter &amp; Rohde, 2013), and morphological cues (Foucart et al., 2016; Grüter et al., 2010; Hopp, 2015; Lew-Williams &amp; Fernald, 2007), unless the two languages are typologically similar (Liburd, 2014; Dussias et al., 2013; Foucart et al., 2014).
    
- ## Advanced late learners: 

    - can use morphological cues to predict morphosyntax (Marull, 2017) and syntax (Dussias et al., 2013; Kaan et al., 2010; Kaan, 2014)
    
    - cannot use morphological cues to predict morphosyntax (Hopp, 2015; Martin et al., 2013), or prosodic cues to predict morphology (Rehrig, 2017). 




???

Multiple studies have come to the conclusion that grammatical gender is a strong cue for anticipation. This has been tested in multiple languages like: spanish, dutch, german or french. 

Is this eye-tracking studies, the participants listen to sentences like "Encuentra la galleta" while the see typically 4 objects on the screen. When only one of the objects is feminine (in this case), the are able to direct their eyes to the cookie right after the determiner "la" is pronounced, and before the noun is said.

Another syntactic cue that has been studied is case-marking, in languages such as Japanese or German.

What happens with second language?

# Interpreters

???

Now I will continue explaining why have chosen this particular bilingual population (besides because of personal reasons). This is me doing an interpreting internship at the Human Rights Council at the UN in Geneva.

# Interpreters &amp; Processing

- Very complex task, Efforts Model (Gile, 2009)
    - Listening, analysis, production, and memory

- Better at: semantic and lexical access, reading speed and comprehension, resistance to articulatory suppression, cognitive flexibility, working memory, phonological short-term memory (Bajo et al, 2000).

- Better than natives at error detection in their L2 (Yudes et al. 2013)

- They adapt the parsing preference for ambiguous sentences depending on the task (reading or interpreting) (Togato et al. 2015)


???

Togato: When reading ambiguous sentences that could be interpreted with both low attachment (preferred by English natives) and high attachment (preferred by Spanish natives), they adapt to the preference according to the task they are doing.

# Interpreters &amp; Anticipation

## Anticipation...

.pull-left[
- is taught in simultaneous interpreting courses (Li, 2015)

- releases cognitive load

- has been studied in language pairs with asymmetrical syntactic structures (SVO/SOV) (Van Besien, 1999)

- happens at high rates and is successful most of o the time (Liontou, 2012)

- is possible thanks to contextual knowledge (both general and from the specific text), and syntactic knowledge (Moser-Mercer, 1978)

]

.pull-right[



- But we still don't know
  - Other cues?
  - Other referents?
  - Interpreting practice enhances anticipation?
]

???

Interpreters are also interesting for this topic because they use anticipation while performing simultaneous interpreting.

# Prosodic cues
 
???

In this coming section, I will review the literature related to the prosodic cues I research: Lexical Stress &amp; Vowel Duration

---

# Lexical Stress

- Relative prominece of a syllable in relation to the rest of syllable in a word.
- Correlates: Tone (F0), duration (ms), and intesity (dB)
- Contrastive in English and Spanish, but used differently

--

.pull-left[

### English
- Stress-timed 
  - Unstressed vowels: reduction [ə] 
- English natives use suprasegmental information for lexical access, but segmental information has a stronger role in lexical activation (Cooper et al., 2002).
- Mandarin L2ers of English use only suprasegmental cues and Korean L2ers use both segmental and suprasegmental cues (Connell et al., 2018) 
]

--

.pull-right[

### Spanish
- Syllable-timed 
  - Stressed vowels: slightly longer
  - Spanish natives rely on F0, intensity and duration to identify stress
- English L2 learners of Spanish have problems with stress production and perception (Face, 2006; Lord, 2007). 
- Both suprasegmental and segmental information contribute equally to the activation of word forms (Soto-Faraco et al., 2001)

]

???

Constrative means that it changes meaning: PApa vs. paPÁ, CONtent vs. conTENT

---
# Vowel Duration

- Neither English or Spanish and quantity languages (Monroy Casas, 2004)
- Differences are greater in English

.pull-left[

## English

- Compression effects: more segments less vowel duration (Katz, 2012)
- Changes in vowel duration affect processing (Lepage &amp; Busà, 2013)

]

--

.pull-right[

## Spanish

- Intrinsic differences: /a/ &gt; /e, o/ &gt; /u, i/ (Marín Gálvez, 1995)
- Affected by stress
- Spanish L2 learners of English: use vowel duration over 
- Spanish natives are sensitive to duration changes only with new vowel qualities (Chládkova, Escudero &amp; Lipski, 2013)

]


---

# Prosodic Cues to Predict Morphology

.pull-left[

## L1

- Contrastive intonation guides the initial syntactic analysis (for Japanese Nakamura et al., 2012)

- English owel duration preactivates upcoming morphology (active/pasive verbs) (Stromswold et al., 2002)

- Swedish word-tones preactive upcoming morhphology (present/past, singular/plural)
]

--

.pull-right[

## L2

- Advanced L2ers cannot use vowel duration for prediction (Rehrig, 2017)

- Advanced L2ers can use word tones for prediction (Schremm et al., 2016)

- Beginning L2ers cannot use word tones (Gosselke Berthelse et al, 2018)

- It is possible to explicitly train morphological prediction based on word-tones (at beginner level) (Schremm et al., 2017)

# Eye-tracking: sample trial

???
After calibration, the participant saw a fixation cross for 250ms, followed by 1000ms of the two possible words (as it is standard in visual world paradigm experiments), and then they listened to a sentence containing one of the two words.

# Eye-tracking task: lexical stress and vowel duration to anticipate morphology

.pull-left[

### Lexical stress

- 16 sentences
  - 8 paroxytone (present verbs)
  - 8 oxytone (past verbs)
  - 7 CVC and 9 CV (1st syllable)

- 5 words long

- Semantically viable (for both conditions)

&lt;ru-blockquote&gt;La mujer llena/llenó la jarra. (The woman fills/filled the jar)  &lt;/ru-blockquote&gt;
]


.pull-right[

### Vowel duration

- 16 sentences
  - 8 monosyllabic (CVC)
  - 8 disyllabic (CVCVC)


- 5 words long

- Semantically viable (for both conditions)


&lt;ru-blockquote&gt;El cocinero escogió col/coles para el menú (The cook chose cauliflower/s for the menu) &lt;/ru-blockquote&gt;

  - Determine whether participants can anticipate

- GLMM

  - Establish group differences

- Growth Curve Analysis

This graph shows us the proportion of fixations to the target and distractor in the three groups in our target area

Because of differences in word frequency, we removed two most frequent items

10ms bins
Time course centered around offset target syllable 
Interest area = earliest target word onset to target syllable onset

Are they better than chance?

-End target syllables
-one-sided t-test
-Proportions against chance
-Next graph we compare the three different groups


---

background-image: url(./img/vowel_glmm.png)

Are they different from each other?

-Linear model:

Main effect of group: int higher target fixation than the other two groups
Main effect of condition: all cases bi is higher than mono

There was no main effect of the interaction of group and condition

-Upper bound confidence interval and now we can compare the groups

How are the groups different from each other for each condition?

In this graph: we’re looking at the predictive model fit of the growth curve analysis
GCA: multilevel modeling technique that allows you to model time as a higher order polynomial. What this means is that you can fit curves to the functional form of the data and it allows you to assess grade of change.

Main effect of group on the intercept: int fixate on the target at a higher rate than

(in GCA: the intercept refers to the middle of the time course, not the traditional Y intercept)

Main effect of condition on the quadratic polynomial: faster rate of fixation in the disyllabic condition
	This is supported by what we found on previous analyses

t-test. Can they do it? Only MON and IN fixated on target words above chance at the target syllable offset (both conditions). NIN did not fixate on targets above chance after adjunting the alpha level for multiple testing.

glmmm. Main effect of group and syllable structure. NIN lower fixation rate than monolinguals. Target fixations of IN = MON. Presence of a coda = increased chance of fixating at the target.

GCA. Main effect on group for the slope and the quadratic term. NIN lower fixation than M (slower at fixating). Group by coda interaction on the intercept: both IN and NINfixated on CV targets less than MON. Group by coda interaction on the slope for IN: faster fixations to the target. (we can see it on the graph, IN curve is steeper, it starts with lower fixations than the MON, but it reaches the same level by the offset of the target syllable)

# Discussion

---

# 1. Do Spanish monolinguals, interpreter/non-interpreter L2 learners use lexical stress to anticipate morphological information? If yes, does syllabic structure (CV, CVC) influence their anticipatory abilities? 


- Monolinguals &amp; interpreters fixate on targets earlier than non-interpreters = INTERPRETER ADVANTAGE.

- Non-interpreters can predict if CVC, but can’t if CV.

    - CV: Interpreters initially fixate less, but at a faster rate than natives (they get to the same point by target offset)
    - CVC: interpreters = monolinguals


---

# 2. Do Spanish monolinguals, interpreter/non-interpreter L2 learners use vowel duration to anticipate morphological information?


- Only interpreters can use duration to anticipate in both conditions.

- All groups perform better in the disyllabic condition.


---

# 3. Does interpreting experience train anticipatory processing?

- YES, interpreters perform closer to monolinguals.

- Non-interpreters (LA): Only anticipate when more time and phonological information are present (lexical stress: CVC condition).

- Monolinguals and interpreters fixate on targets more than non-interpreters = INTERPRETER ADVANTAGE.

# Conclusions

1. Our findings support models advocating that it is possible to train anticipatory processing (Schremm, et al., 2017).

2. Qualitatively (can they do it?): it is possible to learn L2 anticipatory patterns (non-interpreters) post-puberty, and “practice makes you better” (interpreters).

3. Quantitatively (how early do they predict?): the monolinguals are the winners.

4. Important cues in the L1 can be transfered to the L2 with the appripriate trainning.

I wanted to end with a quote that I believe captures why anticipation is important, although probably not necessary for comprehension.
